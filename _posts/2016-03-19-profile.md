My name is Kevin Scherer.

I live in northwest Arkansas, am remarried and have five beautiful daughters. Vocationally, I work as a chaplain for Tyson Foods. Formerly, I was an Orthodox priest, and before that an Evangelical pastor.

Everyday I try to take seriously the gift and responsibility of my humanity - learning how to live in the tension of productivity and presence.

I hope through this website I can get to know you, and we can reflect together on what it means to be truly human.

I hope you'll take a moment to introduce yourself: kevin@createdhuman.com
