Welcome to my new website. I created this site to share updates on my new book: Truly Human.

In a world that appears more broken than ever, the widely used
and accepted adage, "we're only human" is hardly reassuring. If we're honest with ourselves, most of us
are confused about what it means to be human. The purpose of Truly Human is to encapsulate the
Christian teaching on human nature and equip individuals to recover their
God-given, human identity and destiny through the transformative practices and
virtues of the Christian faith.
