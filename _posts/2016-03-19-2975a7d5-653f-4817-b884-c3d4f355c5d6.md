What do people mean when they say, "We're only human"? If it means we're broken, imperfect and flawed, then what does it mean when Christians say that Jesus is fully human?

If truth be told, I think most people, especially Christians, are confused about what it means to be human. How is it that in each one of us the virtuous and the vicious can exist side-by-side? 

The purpose of my new book, _Truly Human, _is to explain the
Christian teaching on human nature and help people recover their
God-given, human identity and destiny.
